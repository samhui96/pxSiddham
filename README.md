# pxSiddham

pxSiddham is a pixelated font for [Siddham script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddha%E1%B9%83_script), which is extinct in India but still in use in East Asia, particularly in Japanese Buddhism.

For many, the first encounter with the blend of Sanskrit and computers is through the song *Navras* from *The Matrix Revolutions*. Later, while studying Siddham at a Buddhist college in Hong Kong, I learned that Sanskrit's grammar is logical like a computer program. What happens when AI learns Sanskrit? Does it [rain]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_digital_rain) green Siddham in its dark matrix? Since the most commonly used script for writing Sanskrit today, [Devanagari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari), features horizontally connected letters and is difficult to ‘rain’, pxSiddham was created to make it happen.

There are certain written forms for Siddham. This font is primarily based on the form curated by [Brahmavidyāvihāra 梵明院](https://www.brhvid.com/siddham). It draws from historic manuscripts and inscriptions originating from India, Nepal and China, and differ slightly from the Japanese form that is more commonly encountered. Developing this font will be an extensive process as it is my first attempt at font creation, and the script involves numerous diacritics, ligatures, and complex text layout requirements.
