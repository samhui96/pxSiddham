# pxSiddham

pxSiddham is a pixelated font for [Siddham script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddha%E1%B9%83_script), which is extinct in India but still in use in East Asia, especially in Japanese Buddhism. Learnt the abugida few years ago, I think it is fun to give such ancient letters a digital look in the contemporary era.

There are certain written forms for Siddham. This font mainly refers to the form created by [Brahmavidyāvihāra 梵明院](https://www.brhvid.com/siddham), it is based on the historic manuscripts and inscriptions from India, Nepal and China, which is slightly different from the Japanese form that is more commonly seen.
