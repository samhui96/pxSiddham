# pxSiddham

pxSiddham is a pixelated font for [Siddham script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddha%E1%B9%83_script), which is extinct in India but still in use in East Asia, especially in Japanese Buddhism.

Perhaps like many of us, our first encounter of the collaboration of Sanskrit and the computers is from the film *The Matrix Revolutions*’ credit song, *Navras*. Much Later, when I learnt Siddham few years ago in a Buddhist college in Hong Kong, I know a little bit more about Sanskrit that it has a grammar as logical as a computer program. What happens when an AI learnt Sanskrit? Does it [rain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_digital_rain) green Siddham in its dark matrix? (The most common script to write Sanskrit nowadays,[Devanagari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari), is not easy to ‘rain’ as the letters stick together by a line.) There should be a retro font let it rain and that is pxSiddham's origin.

There are certain written forms for Siddham. This font mainly refers to the form sorted out by [Brahmavidyāvihāra 梵明院](https://www.brhvid.com/siddham), it is based on the historic manuscripts and inscriptions from India, Nepal and China, which is slightly different from the Japanese form that is more commonly seen.
